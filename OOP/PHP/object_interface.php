//methods are specified in an interface but not defined. any class that implements an interface bust contain te methods specified in the interface.
//all the methods specified are public.
//classes can implement more than one interface but there must not be any intersection of methods with different structure. methods with same name and structure in two interfaces are ok.
// interfaces can be extended using the "extends" keyword.
//interfaces can also have constants which cannot be overridden.
