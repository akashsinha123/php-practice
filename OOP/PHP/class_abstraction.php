// abstract classes may not be instantiated but can be inherited.
//any class containing abstract method should also be abstract.
// when inheriting a class, any method that is abstarct must be defined in the child class, also the no. of arguments must be the same although the child class may define optional arguments.
//the above rule also applis to constructors.
//additionally, these methods must be defined with the same (or less restriction).
